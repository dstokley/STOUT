To compile and link:
g++ -static -L/usr/lib/avaspec -I/usr/lib/avaspec main.cc -lavaspec -m32

Error received:
/tmp/cciHXl5j.o: In function `main':
main.cc:(.text+0x17): undefined reference to `AVS_Init'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

This occurs even though it appears that AVS_Init is defined somewhere in libavaspec.a
at some point
