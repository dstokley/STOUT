Requirements:
-------------
* make and a C and C++ compiler
* optionally libjpeg v6 or later
* optionally Qt4 for building qv4l2

Building:
---------

If you checked out the source repository you need to install the autotools
environment and gettext first. Then type "autoreconf -vfi" to generate the
configure script.

Then execute "configure" with any desired options. You can get a summary via
the --help option.
After configuration simply type "make" to start the build process.

Installing:
-----------

To install do "make install". The configured paths will be used.

Note that v4l-utils' "make install" supports DESTDIR for installing into
a build root for example:
make install DESTDIR=/mnt/sysimage

Cross Compiling:
----------------

Cross compiling has been tested with the Code Sourcery and Linaro ARM Linux
toolchain.

To cross compile with the Code Sourcery toolchain run the following commands:

export PATH=/opt/arm-2009q3/bin:$PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/path/to/cross/root/lib
./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi --without-jpeg
make

To cross compile with the Linaro toolchain run the following commands:

export PATH=/opt/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-2012.09-20120921_linux/bin:$PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/path/to/cross/root/lib
./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf --without-jpeg
make

Android Cross Compiling and Installing:
----------------

v4l-utils will only build using the complete AOSP source tree, because of the
stlport dependency.

List of v4l-utils that supply an Android.mk makefile:
* utils/v4l2-compliance
* utils/v4l2-ctl
* utils/v4l2-dbg

To cross compile an utility you must first configure the shell with Android's
envsetup.sh to add the mm alias, before running lunch to select your target
device.

cd /path/to/aosp
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch
cd /path/to/v4l-utils
cd <utility>
mm

Output binary will be located in the Android out directory, below the
target/product/<name>/system/bin/<v4l-utils executable name> path.

The binary executable can be pushed to the target Android device using
adb push <v4l-utils executable> /system/bin
